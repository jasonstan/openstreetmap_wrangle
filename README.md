## Wrangling OpenStreetMap data

The goal of this project was to get my hands dirty with OpenStreetMap data. OSM is an open source platform, so the quality of data for any given area depends hugely on the community of users that is inputing and editing it. I dug into the NYC data (this area) because this is one of the most developed parts of the OSM dataset.
